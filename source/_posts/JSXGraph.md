### Interactive Geometry, plotting, visualization

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting, charting, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely in JavaScript, does **not** rely on any other library, and uses SVG, VML, or canvas. JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a [small footprint:](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/documentation/file-sizes/) less than 100 KByte if embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! Special care has been taken to optimize the performance.

Starting with version 0.80, JSXGraph supports multitouch devices like the Apple iPad. Since version 0.82 the canvas element is supported, too. That means, JSXGraph also runs on Android devices.

JSXGraph is developed at the [Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mathematik und ihre Didaktik](http://did.mat.uni-bayreuth.de/), University of Bayreuth, Germany.
